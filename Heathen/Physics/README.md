## Installation
* Package Manager
We strongly recommend you clone the repository to your local disk. The simplest way to do this is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), once you have that installed you can easily clone any repository to your local disk.

Once you have the repository cloned to your local disk you can use Unity's Package Manager to import any of the packages you like into your project.

1. Open the Unity Package Manager
2. Click the + button
3. Select the "Add from Disk" option

4. Select the package.json for the asset you would like to import. for example ./SourceRepo/Unity/Physics/heathen.physkit/package.json

## Description
PhysKit is a collection of battle-tested physics systems and tools to help you do more.

### Ballistics
Calculate the trajectory of projectiles quickly and efficiently with complete control over arc height, ground speed, launch velocity and more, and of course it is all physically simulated.

### Buoyancy
Make it float with easy-to-use tools to calculate the buoyancy force on a rigid body, modify drag based on floating conditions and more! Our buoyancy tools can be easily hooked up to just about any ocean/water simulation tool.

### Force Effects
A powerful toolchain that can be used to create magnets, localized gravity, spherical gravity, dampening fields and so much more! Everything is configurable and highly extensible.

### Verlet Spring
Also called a "Dynamic Bone" or "Physics Bone" or "Swing Bone" Heathen's Verlet integration however can be applied to any transform and supports collision detection and back propagation of force effects along the hierarchy. Integrate physics-driven motion through a chain of transforms with a fast and easy-to-use Verlet integration. Make hair sway, props bounce, simulate softbody-like behaviour (jiggle and bounce), ropes, chains and so much more!

## Samples and Extras
### Breakable Wood Props
A collection of props that work with the Breakable and IDestroy features of the Physics asset. Note that these assets are imported using the default Unity material. This ensures compatibility with all rendering pipelines without bloating the installation. You can download and install Built-In, URP or HDRP materials free.
